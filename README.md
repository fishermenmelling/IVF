# IVF
app to help with IVF process (download zip to get the full repository)

open the zipfile in Xcode and you will see the files on the side are all red. 
To fix that move the folders with all the files still in them from the IVF.zip file (after that gets extracted by you) to the same bar as the red lettered files in the Xcode file bar. 
Delete the red lettered files in the bar and then press the "play" button around the top left corner of the screen.

This was a project to help people going through the IVF process. My sister who is a nurse came up with the idea. 
This project is currently put on hold.
